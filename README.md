# NETFLIX CLONE 

A Netflix-like mobile application built with Flutter, using The Movie Database (TMDB) API for fetching movie data and BLoC for state management.


## Introduction

The Netflix Clone App is a mobile application designed to mimic the basic functionality of Netflix. It allows users to browse movies, view details, and see trending content. This project is built using Flutter, with the TMDB API as the data source and BLoC architecture for state management.

## Features

- **Browse Movies**: View a list of movies, including popular, top-rated, and upcoming.
- **Movie Details**: Get detailed information about each movie, including cast, release date, and ratings.
- **Search**: Find movies by searching through the available content.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both portrait and landscape orientations.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **BLoC**: A predictable state management library that helps implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern.
- **TMDB API**: An API that provides access to a vast database of movies, TV shows, and actors.
